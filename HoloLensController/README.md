# HoloLens Controller

Unity application for HoloLens (Gen 1) to visualize and use the hand controller. Motion tracking data and button taps from the controller device are received via MQTT.

Features two showcases:
- Using the controller device as hand controller to spawn and move cubes around with a far interaction ray
- Lightsaber mode, where the hand controller is a lighsaber that can be extended and retracted
