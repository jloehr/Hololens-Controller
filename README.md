# Hololens-Controller

Master's project to use a Google Tango Android phone as a controller for  Hololens (Gen 1).

A more detailed report on the project, as well as my thesis paper, can be found on the project site: [https://www.julianloehr.de/educational-work/microsoft-hololens-hand-controller/](https://www.julianloehr.de/educational-work/microsoft-hololens-hand-controller/)

# Demo Video

Small demo video of the project in use. First the setup is manually initated on the phone. After turning around once, to scan the room with the Tango device, the room alignment eventually settles. Afterwards it showcases using the phone as hand controller with a far interaction ray, placing and moving cubes in the room.
